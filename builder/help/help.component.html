    This guide covers the basics:
    * How to create an application
    * How to add a dashboard
    * How to configure the navigation
    * Styling the application

    ## Creating an application

    4. Enter a name, and icon ([pick one from this list](http://styleguide.cumulocity.com/icons/icons/#)). If you have selected to copy or link to an existing dashboard then enter the id of the dashboard.
    There are a few ways to get a dashboard's ID:
    * Check the URL
    * Add an HTML widget to the dashboard with the code: `Dashboard ID: {{'{{id}' + '}'}}`

    ## Configuring the navigation
    1. Open the application that you would like to configure the navigation for.

    ![App Configuration](./images/AppConfiguration.png)

    2. Drag the handle on the left of the dashboard name to reorder the navigation.
    3. Folders can be created by including a `/` in the dashboard's name when creating.

    If you want to rename a dashboard create a new dashboard and use the link option, enter the ID and then delete the old dashboard.

    ## Styling the Application

    To change the application's color select a theme or manually enter colors into the fields at the bottom.
    Setting a logo allows you to add a company logo to the application's navigation. You also have the option to hide the application icon and only use the logo.
