    2. Drag the handle on the left of the dashboard name to reorder the navigation.
    3. Folders can be created by including a `/` in the dashboard's name when creating.

    If you want to rename a dashboard create a new dashboard and use the link option, enter the ID and then delete the old dashboard.

    ## Styling the Application

    To change the application's color select a theme or manually enter colors into the fields at the bottom.
